Install jest according to the instructions at  https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/57428/pages/installing-jest-testing-framework?module_item_id=729444, but note that the config-file `jest.config.js` is already downloaded to this repository, so you may skip that step.


1. compile with `tsc helloworld.ts`
2. run the javascript with `node helloworld.js`

The file `.gitignore` is to tell git, the version control software, to not track the compiled output files.
You can safely ignore that file and pretend it does not exist.
