# A Game of Nim

This repository contains the code for Lesson 11 in the PKD course.

The instructions below assume your home folder for course work (where you have all code) is called `~/PKD/Code`, and that you have installed Jest, ESLint and TypeScript, as instructed on Studium.

1. Download this repository. Either as a zip-file that you unzip into `~/PKD/Code/lesson11` or run `cd ~/PKD/Code` and `git clone https://github.com/malyzajko/nim.git lesson11` (the 'lesson11' in the clone command will name the resulting folder 'lesson11').
2. Install `npm install --save prompt-sync` and `npm install --save-dev @types/prompt-sync` (in your ~/PKD/Code folder)
3. Compile all code files by `tsc ~/PKD/Code/lesson11/*.ts`, or go into the lesson11/ folder and run 'tsc *.ts'
4. Run the code (game) with `node ~/PKD/Code/lesson11/main.js`, or if you are in the lesson11/ folder: 'node main.js'
