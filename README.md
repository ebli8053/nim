# A Game of Nim

This repository contains the code for Lesson11 in he PKD course.

The instructions below assume your home folder for course work (where you have all code) is called `~/PKD`, and that you have installed Jest, eslint and typescript, as instructed on Studium.

1. Download this repository. Either as a zip-file that you unzip into `~/PKD/lesson11` or run `cd ~/PKD` and `git clone https://github.com/el-hult/ts-boilerplate.git lesson11`.
2. Install `npm install --save prompt-sync` and `npm install --save-dev @types/prompt-sync`
3. Compile all files code by `tsc ~/PKD/lesson11/*.ts`
4. Run the code with `node ~/PKD/lesson11/main.js`

When making changes to the code, run `jest ~/PKD/lesson11/*.ts` and `eslint ~/PKD/lesson11/*.ts` to make sure the code still passes all tests and adhere to good code standard.
